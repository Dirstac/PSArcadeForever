# PSARCADEPLUS

What is PSARCADEPLUS+?

Is named  Project Shadow Arcade Plus + (PSARCADE PLUS +), it started in 2019, it is a complete project that has all the features at the same time of the Arcade system, HBMame, Mess.
 
So you can enjoy all arcade game systems in a single version, including all the hacks that currently exist, instead the console systems have been selected the most popular and stable systems of operation, thus being able to give all of you a greater complete collection.
 
It has been very complex to be able to assemble all this system in one, to begin with, the arcade system has been successfully included 99% and the remaining 1% has not been included since some games have an independent configuration and caused greater incompatibility with some controllers.
 
At one point they tried to give new support to the console system, they began to implement the new hacks roms in the Megadrive console system which unfortunately I had to discontinue due to the maximum incompatibility with the Mess system, anyway I will be sharing with you all the progress that has been made.
 
The emulator programs will be compiled for the Windows 64-bit operating system only.
