# PSARCADEPLUS

What is PSARCADEPLUS?

The beginning of this project was in 2017 called the Shadow Arcade Project, where I offer users to have an emulator that has all the features in one, which is focused on combining the source code HBMAME, ARCADE, MESS.

To compile correctly you must use the code source of HBMAME version 0.227.
